#define Project_Language_File_One
// Project language file 1
// For: seanpm2001/Learn-GLSL
// I decided to make GLSL the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-GLSL) as GLSL is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the GLSL programming language. It only makes sense to GLSL the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
